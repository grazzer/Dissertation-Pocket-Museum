# Dissertation-Pocket-Museum-App

This was my master project at Queen Mary university London. 

The application was designed to increase museum visitors by gamifying the experience.
Users can collect artefacts they visit in museums, using NFC tags associated with each artefact. when an NFC tag is scanned a minigame is opened relating the artefacts history or relevance, if completed correct the user adds this artefact to their personal collection.
Additional features not included would allow users to display their collection of artefacts in their own virtual museum.
